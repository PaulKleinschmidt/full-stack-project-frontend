Full Stack Project Frontend for accessing a songs database. Users can sign in and sign up. Users can view a list of songs. Users can select songs they wish to add to their favorites. Users can deleted selected songs from their favorites. Users can update songs in their favorites to a different song from the song resource.

I would still like to add a way to delete and update favorites without having to type in the ID. I would also like to add more info to each song so that there is more than just artist and title.
