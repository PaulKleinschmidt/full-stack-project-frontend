## Paul's Song App Frontend

A single page application made by me. Pauls Song App is an app for accessing a songs database. It can be used to favorite songs and to keep track of which songs you like most! This project was made for General Assembly WDI 21, for full stack application building practice.

## Made with:

- javascript
- html
- css
- handlebars.js

## User Stories

- Users can sign in and sign up
- Users can view a list of songs
- Users can select songs they wish to add to their favorites
- Users can deleted selected songs from their favorites
- Users can update songs in their favorites to a different song from the song resource.

## Development Story
This was my second big project I have built, so there were lots of new challenges to overcome. I tried to stay as organized as possible, keeping my functions small and using seperate files. This was my first time building a backend, and I was still pretty unfamiliar with rails when I began this project. I ended up getting stuck quite a few times when trying to make a search bar. There were MANY different approaches I tried to having a functional search bar but I think my solution turned out pretty good. By the end of the development process, I felt comfortable troubleshooting and solving problems effectively.


## What's next?

At the moment, this app can be used to keep track of favorite songs from a limited database. I would like to add more songs for users to choose from. I'm currently working on turning the favorites tab into more of a "playlist" section. I would like users to be able to update playlist position, so that they can order their favorites. I want to add better styling and a search bar that allows users to search by artist.
